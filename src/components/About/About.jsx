          An escape room, also known as an escape game, puzzle room, exit game,
          or riddle room is a game in which a team of players discover clues,
          solve puzzles, and accomplish tasks in one or more rooms in order to
          accomplish a specific goal in a limited amount of time. The goal is
          often to escape from the site of the game. Most escape games are
          cooperative but competitive variants exist. Escape rooms became
          popular in North America, Europe, and East Asia in the 2010s.
          Permanent escape rooms in fixed locations were first opened in Asia
          and followed later in Hungary, Serbia, Australia, New Zealand, Russia,
          and South America.
